AutoTipJS for Hypixel

1.8.9 - 1.8.8 is RECOMMENDED for the script.

*How to add your own account:*

*Here is the code,*
``const bot = mineflayer.createBot({
  host: "play.hypixel.net",
  port: "25565",
  username: "example@example.com",
  password: "password",
  version: "1.8.8",
});``

*What should I do with it?
First, you see the quotes next to password? Inside that is where you are going to be entering your password.
The username should be the same but you put your email, and regular usernames don't work.
Keep the port and host the same.
Change the version to your liking.
And that is all inside the code.*

This is *pb2319* (public beta, and the numbers are the month, day, and year.)

**YOU MUST HAVE NODE.JS INSTALLED WITH THE MINEFLAYER PACKAGE**

"Installing an package globally
Packages are like addons to the code to make things easier and add more features.

npm install -g <package_name>

This will install this node module globally so you can use it whenever you want."

From https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally, By node.js Dev Team.

**INSTALL NODE.JS HERE: nodejs.org/en/**

Look for the code and do the things I said above.
